### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Stepan Polikanov. I am now a master's student in Madrid. My pronouns are he/him. You can access my CV and additional information at my [website](sapolikanov.github.io).

I am currently working on various data analysis projects. My main scientific focus is on economic history but I am open to a lot of topics in economics and social sciences.

Public repositories represent a part of my data analysis portfolio. While they are meant to showcase my competencies to potential employers, they are not a complete collection of my works.
